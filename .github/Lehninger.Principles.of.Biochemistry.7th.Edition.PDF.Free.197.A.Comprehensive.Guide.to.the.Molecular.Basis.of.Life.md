# Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry 7th Edition PDF Free 197: A Comprehensive Guide to the Molecular Basis of Life
 
Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry is a popular textbook that covers the fundamentals and applications of biochemistry in a clear and coherent way. The 7th edition, published in 2017, is updated with the latest discoveries and advances in the field, such as epigenetics, CRISPR-Cas9, and bioinformatics. The book is divided into five parts: The Foundations of Biochemistry, Structure and Catalysis, Bioenergetics and Metabolism, Information Pathways, and Integrative Themes. Each part consists of several chapters that explore the structure, function, and regulation of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. The book also includes numerous examples, exercises, and case studies that illustrate the relevance of biochemistry to medicine, health, and biotechnology.

## The Foundations of Biochemistry
 
The first part of the book introduces the basic principles and concepts of biochemistry, such as the chemical and physical properties of water, the structure and function of amino acids and proteins, the mechanisms and kinetics of enzyme catalysis, the diversity and roles of carbohydrates and glycobiology, the structure and function of nucleotides and nucleic acids, the techniques and applications of DNA-based information technologies, the structure and function of lipids and biological membranes, and the principles and pathways of biosignaling. This part provides a solid foundation for understanding the molecular logic of life and its evolution.
 
### Water
 
Water is the most abundant and essential molecule in living systems. It has unique properties that make it ideal for supporting life, such as its high polarity, hydrogen bonding, cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, high specific heat, high heat of vaporization, high dielectric constant, and ability to act as a solvent for polar and ionic compounds. Water also participates in many biochemical reactions, such as hydrolysis, condensation, ionization, and redox. Water can exist in three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). The structure and behavior of water depend on its interactions with other molecules and its environment.
 
### Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins
 
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. They have a common structure consisting of a central carbon atom (alpha carbon) bonded to an amino group (NH3+), a carboxyl group (COO-), a hydrogen atom (H), and a variable side chain (R). There are 20 common amino acids found in proteins, each with a unique side chain that determines its chemical properties and interactions. Amino acids can be classified into four groups based on their side chains: nonpolar (hydrophobic), polar (hydrophilic), acidic (negatively charged), and basic (positively charged). Amino acids can be linked together by peptide bonds to form peptides or proteins. Peptides are short chains of amino acids (<50 amino acids), while proteins are long chains of amino acids (>50 amino acids). The sequence of amino acids in a peptide or protein is called its primary structure.
